# **📌 Linear Regression Project**

This project demonstrates a simple and complete implementation of **Linear Regression** using Python.
The repository contains all steps with screenshots—from loading the dataset to training and evaluating the model.

## **📃 What’s Included**

* Data loading and preprocessing
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Train-test split
* Linear Regression model training
* Model evaluation (R², MAE, MSE, RMSE)
* Actual vs Predicted comparison
* All important outputs shown through screenshots

## **🛠️ Tech Used**

Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, Google Colab

## **🎯 Objective**

To understand how Linear Regression works and how to build, train, and evaluate a regression model end-to-end.
